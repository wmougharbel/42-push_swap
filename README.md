# Push_swap

## Overview
The Push_swap project is an exciting and challenging project in the 42 curriculum that explores sorting algorithms and data manipulation. In this project, students are tasked with sorting a stack of integers using specific operations while adhering to strict rules. This project offers a hands-on opportunity to learn about algorithm complexity, optimization, and problem-solving.

## Description
### Sorting with Stacks
Push_swap revolves around the concept of sorting a stack of integers. Students will implement two programs: a checker and a push_swap. The checker program validates whether a series of operations can sort the stack, while the push_swap program generates a sequence of operations to achieve the sorting.

### Project Objectives
- Implement an efficient sorting algorithm to arrange integers in ascending order.
- Develop a push_swap program that generates a sequence of stack operations to sort the integers.
- Implement a checker program to validate the correctness of the sorting operations.
- Optimize the sorting algorithm for minimal operation counts.

## Key Concepts
### Sorting Algorithms
Push_swap provides an excellent opportunity to explore various sorting algorithms, such as insertion sort, quicksort, and others. Students will analyze and select an appropriate algorithm based on performance and efficiency.

### Stack Operations
Students will gain a deep understanding of stack data structures and operations, including push, pop, and swap. These operations are essential for manipulating the stack to achieve the desired sorting.

### Optimization
Optimizing the sorting algorithm for minimal operation counts is a crucial aspect of Push_swap. Students will learn how to analyze and optimize algorithms to reduce execution time and resource usage.

## Challenges
The Push_swap project presents several challenges to students:
- Designing an efficient sorting algorithm with minimal operation counts.
- Developing a push_swap program that generates a valid sequence of stack operations.
- Ensuring the correctness of the sorting operations using the checker program.
- Optimizing the algorithm for performance and efficiency.

## Learning Outcomes
By completing the Push_swap project, students will gain valuable knowledge and experience in the following areas:
- Sorting algorithms and their complexity analysis.
- Stack data structures and operations.
- Algorithm optimization and performance analysis.
- Problem-solving and algorithmic thinking.
- Debugging and testing for algorithm correctness.
